# Mexican Congressional Debates 

This repository contains a `webcrawler` to scrape the Mexican Congressional Debates held in the **CÃ¡mara de Diputados** with a `structured database` that contains the interventions for each representative in the sessions. Also it is provided the metadata of each session (e.g the president of the Chamber, number of representatives present at each session, etc. ). In the following sections are a summary of folders and files, along with a breif tutorial to use the webcrawler and scrape the raw data of the Congressional Debates. 

## Project files

### Webcrawler: Using the scraper
The webcrawler is Python-based, for its use installation is necessary, as well as some Python libraries. 

* **source** - folder containing all the code to scrape as well as a tutorial to run the scraper
  * **main.py** - main code file that is used when running the program
  * **requierements.txt** - txt file with Python Libraries requiered
  * **legislaturas.txt** - txt file with Legislaturas that will be scraped when the program is run

### Data

The data is current as of **fecha de hoy**. There has been a post-processing of the data in comparison to the original sources. I recommend using the webcrawler if you need to use the original data without any pre-processing. 

* **data** - folder containing all the data and codebook. 
  * **metadata.csv** - csv file containing the metadata of each session
  * **congressional_debates.csv** - file containing the legislative debates at the level of session.
  * **representartive_speeches.csv** - csv file with legislative debates at the level of representative.
