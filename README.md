# MX Congressional Data

This repo provides a `dataset that contains measures of legislative behavior` **CÃ¡mara de Diputado's members** of the Mexican Congress. This corpus contains four groups of files: (i) id data of members (including career track and participation in committees) (ii) floor speech data (interventions of each members in debates, metadata of debate, metadata of speaker) (iii) roll call votes, (v) legislative data (bills proposed, etc.) (iv) legislative effort (measure composed of previous variables). For each group of file is also provided webscraping code where the data was obtained (http://www.diputados.gob.mx/sistema_legislativo_LXIV.html). 

`All the datasets includes Legislatura LXV, LXI, LXII, LXIII, LXIV.`
